# Dynamic Draw

## Description

**Dynamic Draw** is a project I worked on in 2024.

While using software like **Paint** and **Blender**, I imagined a 2D drawing application where objects could be modified in 2D the way 3D objects are manipulated in Blender. Given my limited knowledge at the time, I chose to use Python's **Tkinter** library, which I had mastered.

## Features

Dynamic Draw allows users to:
- Draw and edit 2D objects.
- Create custom polygons.
- Insert images.
- Use widgets inside the canvas.
- Work with various geometric shapes.

## Purpose

This project was created purely for learning purposes. There is **no commercial intent** behind it.  
The source code and executable are **free for everyone** to use for learning or testing.

Thank you!
